# Heights and Depths

-----------

The heights of your sorrow,
little do they know.
The depth of your burrow,
that you dug up low.

The heights of your thought,
takes much to think.
The depth of your heart,
can't express in ink.

The heights of your voice,
builds new dreams.
The depth of your scars,
hides your screams.

The heights of those lashes,
that curl up tight.
The depth of the clashes,
they endure at night.

The heights of the wall,
that guards your precious.
The depth of itâ€™s call,
yearns for an analogous.

The heights of their ego,
just let it go.
The depth of their mind,
is so shallow.

The heights of you,
was never meant to measure.
The depth of you,
is only to treasure.
